This project focuses on detecting and correcting hate speech directed at women, specifically tailored for Ireland. Using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, the system processes user inputs, identifies hate speech, and provides real-time corrections with contextual explanations.

**Key Features:**

✅ Hate Speech Detection: Identifies harmful language against women using NLP techniques.

✅ Correction Mechanism: Suggests alternative, non-offensive language.

✅ RAG-based Responses: Provides explanations and citations for corrections.

✅ Source Validation: Ensures factual and reliable responses.

✅ User Feedback: Allows human reviewers to assess accuracy and improve the model.

This project is designed for educational and research purposes, aiming to combat online toxicity while promoting respectful communication.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, MongoDB, OpenAI API, NLP, RAG
